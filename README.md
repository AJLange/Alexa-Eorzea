This is an Alexa skill designed to interface (eventually) with the Final Fantasy XIV API to get server data etc. - https://xivapi.com/

Still learning how to properly do this.

Some of this code is borrowed from the alexa-samples github as a starting point: https://github.com/alexa-samples/skill-sample-python-fact. As such, included the license file here for that work.
